Manuscript Edit & Verification Brief

Reference file: manuscript_MAIN.tex
Workflow: Apply changes to a copy of the final manuscript (Manuscript_DRAFT.tex)

0. Global Instructions for Copilot

Make no stylistic edits unless explicitly requested

Prefer verification + alignment with scripts over rewriting text

Always write in British English

Flag uncertainty with // CHECK: comments rather than guessing

Do not invent statistics or thresholds

If scripts disagree with manuscript, manuscript must be updated to match scripts

1. Scope & Metadata Checks
1.1 Author & Affiliation Cleanup

 Remove submission-inappropriate identifiers (e.g. “University of Bath”)

 Confirm compliance with anonymous / blinded submission rules

2. Methods: Conceptual Accuracy & Alignment
2.1 Intro / Contributions (Line ~70)

Issue: Regression is mentioned but not used as a main analysis

 Verify analyses actually used:

ANOVA / ART-ANOVA

Correlations

SVM

LMM (covariate checks only)

 Update text to:

Either remove “regression”

Or explicitly clarify: LMMs used only for covariate checks, not primary inference

2.2 Participant Statistics (Lines ~127, ~262)

 Recompute age, SD, gender for final N = 44

 Add VR experience statistics (if available in repo - potentially in MAIN branch)

 Ensure stats appear consistently in:

Participants section

Results section

Any tables referencing demographics

2.3 EEG Cleaning & Preprocessing (Line ~160)

 Check clean_eeg.py:

Bad channel thresholds

Interpolation criteria

 Ensure manuscript thresholds exactly match script

If unclear, inspect clean_eeg.py and document explicitly

2.4 EDA / GSR Cleaning (Line ~164)

 Inspect clean_eda.py / clean_gsr.py

 Verify:

Interpolation rules

Gap duration thresholds

 Clarify manuscript text if interpolation is conditional (e.g. ≤5 s only)

2.5 Filters

 Double-check all references to Butterworth filters

 Ensure:

Filter order

Cutoff frequencies

Zero-phase vs causal

 Manuscript must reflect actual scripts used for reported results

2.6 QC Thresholds (Line ~196)

 Verify QC thresholds against scripts

 Update manuscript to ensure exact numerical alignment

2.7 EEG Entropy Methods

 Only one EEG entropy metric is now included

 Merge spectral entropy text into EEG methods section

 Remove redundant or obsolete entropy method descriptions

3. Machine Learning Methods
3.1 SVM Evaluation Metrics

 Inspect SVM.R

 Verify:

Primary evaluation metric (AUC vs accuracy)

 Update manuscript to:

Clearly state primary metric

Avoid redundancy / repetition in SVM section

3.2 Permutation Testing

 Verify whether permutation tests were based on:

Accuracy

AUC

 Ensure this is explicitly stated in the manuscript

 If not stated, add a concise clarification

4. Results: Statistical Reporting Consistency
4.1 Significance Reporting Policy (Global)

Change in policy due to sparse significance

 Remove “Significance” column from all tables

 Mark statistically significant results in bold

 Explicitly explain this convention in every relevant table caption

4.2 ART-ANOVA Results

 New ART-ANOVA tables show no significant effects

 Decide and implement:

Drop post-hoc tables entirely?

Keep but remove significance framing?

 Decide how to handle near-significance (do not over-interpret)

4.3 Response-Rate-Controlled Features

 Check whether any features become significant after controlling for response rate

 If yes:

Decide whether to report as:

Supplementary analysis

Main result

 Note: these features were not used in SVM, so be cautious

4.4 Subjective Metrics: Factorial Analysis

 Verify updated factorial stats:

MWL × Stress interaction now non-significant

Correlation differences between congruent / incongruent conditions reduced

 Ensure results text reflects new statistics only

4.5 Abstract Consistency

EDA–Stress Relationship

 Abstract currently claims:

“despite modest univariate sensitivity of tonic EDA…”

 New stats:

p ≈ 0.053

partial η² ≈ 0.03 (same as HR)

 Update abstract to avoid overstating univariate significance

5. Discussion–Results Alignment
5.1 Subjective Interaction Interpretation

 If stress × MWL interaction is non-significant:

Re-evaluate discussion claims about stress increasing perceived workload

Either soften language or remove paragraph

5.2 Condition-Wise Correlations (Line ~456)

 Currently discussed but not reported in Results

 Decide:

Add to Results section

Or remove from Discussion entirely

6. Missing or Optional Analyses
6.1 Covariates, ICC, Domain Ablations

 Check repo for:

Covariate analysis scripts

ICC computation

Domain / sensor ablation results

top k robustness check

 Decide whether to:

Include in main manuscript

Move to supplementary

Drop entirely

7. Related Work Reporting Standards

 Decide consistency for reported metrics:

Accuracy only?

AUC only?

Both?

 Align related work reporting with how your own models are evaluated

8. Final Consistency Sweep

 All numerical values traceable to scripts

 No analysis described that is not actually run

 No results discussed that are not reported

 Abstract ↔ Results ↔ Discussion fully aligned
