"""
Private helper modules for physiological feature extraction.

This package contains modular components for:
- Data loading and caching
- Signal cleaning (HR, GSR, eye tracking)
- Feature extraction
- Merging with EEG and subjective data
- Quality control logging

Each module is self-contained and testable.
