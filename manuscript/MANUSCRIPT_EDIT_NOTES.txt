Manuscript Edit & Verification Brief

Reference file: manuscript_MAIN.tex
Workflow: Apply changes to a copy of the final manuscript (Manuscript_DRAFT.tex)

0. Global Instructions for Copilot

Make no stylistic edits unless explicitly requested

Prefer verification + alignment with scripts over rewriting text

Always write in British English

Flag uncertainty with // CHECK: comments rather than guessing

Do not invent statistics or thresholds

If scripts disagree with manuscript, manuscript must be updated to match scripts

1. Scope & Metadata Checks
1.1 Author & Affiliation Cleanup

 [x] Remove submission-inappropriate identifiers (e.g. “University of Bath”)

 [x] Confirm compliance with anonymous / blinded submission rules

2. Methods: Conceptual Accuracy & Alignment
2.1 Intro / Contributions (Line ~70)

Issue: Regression is mentioned but not used as a main analysis

 [x] Verify analyses actually used:

ANOVA / ART-ANOVA

Correlations

SVM

LMM (covariate checks only)

 [x] Update text to:

Either remove “regression”

Or explicitly clarify: LMMs used only for covariate checks, not primary inference

2.2 Participant Statistics (Lines ~127, ~262)

 [x] Recompute age, SD, gender for final N = 44

 [x] Add VR experience statistics (if available in repo - potentially in MAIN branch)

 [x] Ensure stats appear consistently in:

Participants section

Results section

Any tables referencing demographics

2.3 EEG Cleaning & Preprocessing (Line ~160)

 [x] Check clean_eeg.py:

Bad channel thresholds

Interpolation criteria

 [x] Ensure manuscript thresholds exactly match script

If unclear, inspect clean_eeg.py and document explicitly

2.4 EDA / GSR Cleaning (Line ~164)

 [x] Inspect clean_eda.py / clean_gsr.py

 Verify:

Interpolation rules

Gap duration thresholds

 [x] Clarify manuscript text if interpolation is conditional (e.g. ≤5 s only)

2.5 Filters

 [x] Double-check all references to Butterworth filters

 Ensure:

Filter order

Cutoff frequencies

Zero-phase vs causal

 [x] Manuscript must reflect actual scripts used for reported results

2.6 QC Thresholds (Line ~196)

 [x] Verify QC thresholds against scripts

 [x] Update manuscript to ensure exact numerical alignment

2.7 EEG Entropy Methods

 [x] Only one EEG entropy metric is now included

 [x] Merge spectral entropy text into EEG methods section

 [x] Remove redundant or obsolete entropy method descriptions

3. Machine Learning Methods
3.1 SVM Evaluation Metrics

 [x] Inspect SVM.R

 [x] Verify:

Primary evaluation metric (AUC vs accuracy)

 [x] Update manuscript to:

Clearly state primary metric

Avoid redundancy / repetition in SVM section

3.2 Permutation Testing

 [x] Verify whether permutation tests were based on:

Accuracy

AUC

 [x] Ensure this is explicitly stated in the manuscript

 [x] If not stated, add a concise clarification

4. Results: Statistical Reporting Consistency
4.1 Significance Reporting Policy (Global)

Change in policy due to sparse significance

 [x] Remove “Significance” column from all tables

 [x] Mark statistically significant results in bold

 [x] Explicitly explain this convention in every relevant table caption

4.2 ART-ANOVA Results

 New ART-ANOVA tables show no significant effects

 [x] Decide and implement:

[x] Drop post-hoc tables entirely? (Dropped tab:eda_posthoc)

Keep but remove significance framing?

 [x] Decide how to handle near-significance (do not over-interpret)

4.3 Response-Rate-Controlled Features

 [x] Check whether any features become significant after controlling for response rate (Checked: No significant effects found)

 If yes:

Decide whether to report as:

Supplementary analysis

Main result

 Note: these features were not used in SVM, so be cautious

4.4 Subjective Metrics: Factorial Analysis

 [x] Verify updated factorial stats:

MWL × Stress interaction now non-significant

Correlation differences between congruent / incongruent conditions reduced

 [x] Ensure results text reflects new statistics only

4.5 Abstract Consistency

EDA–Stress Relationship

 Abstract currently claims:

“despite modest univariate sensitivity of tonic EDA…”

 New stats:

p ≈ 0.053

partial η² ≈ 0.03 (same as HR)

 [x] Update abstract to avoid overstating univariate significance

5. Discussion–Results Alignment
5.1 Subjective Interaction Interpretation

 [x] If stress × MWL interaction is non-significant:

[x] Re-evaluate discussion claims about stress increasing perceived workload

[x] Either soften language or remove paragraph (Removed/Rewritten)

5.2 Condition-Wise Correlations (Line ~456)

 Currently discussed but not reported in Results

 [x] Decide:

Add to Results section

[x] Or remove from Discussion entirely (Removed)

6. Missing or Optional Analyses
6.1 Covariates, ICC, Domain Ablations

 [x] Check repo for:

Covariate analysis scripts (Found: results/manuscript_verification/covariate_analysis.txt)

ICC computation (Found: results/manuscript_verification/icc_results.txt)

Domain / sensor ablation results (Found: results/svm_ablation_runs/full_run_20251219_123204)

top k robustness check (Not found, but k=5 is standard)

 [x] Decide whether to:

Include in main manuscript (Included: Covariates/ICC in 4.4, Ablations in 4.3)

Move to supplementary

Drop entirely

7. Related Work Reporting Standards

 [x] Decide consistency for reported metrics:

Accuracy only?

AUC only?

Both? (Reporting Accuracy, F1, and AUC)

 [x] Align related work reporting with how your own models are evaluated

8. Final Consistency Sweep

 [x] All numerical values traceable to scripts

 [x] No analysis described that is not actually run

 [x] No results discussed that are not reported

 [x] Abstract ↔ Results ↔ Discussion fully aligned
